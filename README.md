# Let’s discuss the actual functionality that we are expecting from the application.

1 First, the user will enter the bill amount.

2 Using the second numericUpDown box, the user will input the percentage (%) of the tip applicable for the service.

3 Using the third numericUpDown box, the user will input the number of people for splitting the bill.

4 Upon clicking the button, the user should get the tip and total bill amount.

5 We have a textbox where only numeric value is allowed, if a user can put any other value into it then it gives an error.


# Here is the hierarchy that we have placed for our application.

1 At the top, we have the title for the application. It can be set by changing the text property of the Form.

2 This text box will be used to get the bill amount from the user.

3 In the next series, we have another label and numericUpDown components — this second text box will be used to get the percentage (%) value of the tip from the user.

4 Below these we have a label with content Tip amount after clicking calculate button, giving expected output into this label.

5 Below these we have a label name Total after click button which, upon clicking, will calculate the tip value and add it to the bill amount, to give the total bill amount.

6 After this there is the numericUpDown name Number of person (label) take user input as how many people are splitting the bill?

7 Below these we have a label which shows the tip per person after clicking on the calculate button.

8 The labels placed next will display the tip per person  and total per person amount separately.

Here are the screenshot of the application:
